# Sort Visualizer

## Overview

This is an app that visualizes the process of sorting a random array of numbers. I used HTML, CSS, JS and React to make this project.

I used React mostly for keeping things in order, while using JS and CSS for most of the front-end.

## Technologies Used

## What was learned?

I spent a lot of time trying to write the algorithms for the program. The problem was that I didn't only have to write algorithms for this, I also had to write it so that it changed the visualization in the front-end. If I were to make this program again, I would write it more structurally so that the algorithms can be implemented by just writing the code for that algorithm, and another script can take care of th e moving the array elements around.
